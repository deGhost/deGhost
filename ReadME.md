## Creating content online
### Youtube
I believe that the best way to learn something is to teach it. For this reason I created a Youtube channel where I share programming related topics that I recently learned or I'm currently learning.  [Check my channel here!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOilWFnZq8VitNeABQpzOGQ)

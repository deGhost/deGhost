## Bachelor's degree in Computer Science

For my final year project, I developed an Android app "WiStudy" for facilating exchange between teachers and students by offering virtual classes managed by teachers. 

## Master's degree in Computer Science

I specialized in data bases. During two years, I learned about data transformation, data integration using different technologies (Talend, SparQL, PostgreSQL...etc.), also about Cloud computing and Machine learning for Image processing.
For my graduation project, I worked on presenting an ML solution to optimize the security of IoT routing protocol by integrating Trust Management.
